Welcome to Siyuan's Feature Selection Algorithm.

Enter dataset filename: titanic-clean.txt

This dataset has 6 features (not including the class attribute), with 714 instances.

Running nearest neighbor with no features (random baseline), using "leaving-one-out" evaluation, I get an accuracy of 50.0%

Type the number of the algorithm you want to run.
